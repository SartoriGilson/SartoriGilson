## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub.

My name is Gilson Mariani Sartori from Brazil (🇧🇷). I'm starting my career in the programming area and I have a portfolio for your analysis, these repositories are the results of the courses I've been constantly studying. I'm studying to become a full stack professional but focused on backend

In my free time I like a lot watch football (🏈) and F1 (🏎️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚) and listen to music (🎵).

Would you like to find me?
